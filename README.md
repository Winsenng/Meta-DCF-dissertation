Meta Platforms, Inc. Investment Analysis and Valuation

This project contains my master's dissertation and the Excel-based Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model used for the valuation of Meta Platforms, Inc.. The research aimed to determine whether Metaâ€™s stock was overvalued or undervalued as of June 28, 2024, based on a fundamental analysis of its financials.

Key Components:

ðŸ“„ Dissertation: A comprehensive report analyzing Metaâ€™s financial statements, industry trends, and macroeconomic conditions to develop a 5-year financial forecast. The study applies a DCF valuation model and includes a bull and bear case scenario analysis to assess investment risk and upside potential.

ðŸ“Š DCF Model (Excel): Built from scratch using Metaâ€™s historical financial data, this model calculates free cash flows, determines the enterprise and equity value, and derives an implied share price. Sensitivity analysis is included to test the impact of key assumptions.

This project showcases my ability to conduct fundamental investment analysis, build financial models, and apply valuation techniques to real-world companies.
